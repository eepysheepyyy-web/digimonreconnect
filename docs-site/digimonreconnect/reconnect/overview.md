# Digimon: ReConnect

---
**Digimon ReConnect** is a multi-episode animated fan series that revisits the characters from *Digimon Adventure* and *Digimon Adventure 02* as adults. It explores the challenges of growing up, balancing Digimon adventures with adult responsibilities, and embraces the core message: *It's okay to keep your Digimon partner by your side as long as you balance personal growth and relationships.*

This project is a personal creative endeavor led by EepySheepyyy. While the ultimate goal is a fully animated series, realistically it may only reach storyboard or animatic stages due to limited resources. As this is a fan project based on copyrighted material, I do not anticipate external assistance, voice acting, or funding. It's a passion project pursued for the love of the story and characters.

Updates will be shared as progress is made. There is currently no set release schedule or completion criteria; these will be determined as the project advances.
